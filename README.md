collection of scripts to control your computer with voice recognition, MIDI controllers and possibly more.

## FCB1010

script for running various actions from FCB1010 footpedals. Not generic code at all, just copy and modify for your own purposes. Now includes a menu system in bank 9. If you tail -f the choices file in a terminal, it'll display various menu choices (probably only practical if you're running a tiling window manager or have the terminal in an always-visible overlay)

## to do

* cleanup and refactor code, it is currently super hacky
* support for MIDI controllers
* proper requires
* set up gemspec
